🕵‍♂ Fake Profile Detection in Social Networking Websites Using Machine Learning

📘 Project Overview

Social media platforms like Facebook, Twitter, Instagram, and LinkedIn have become integral parts of our lives, connecting millions of people worldwide. However, these platforms also face the growing issue of fake or bogus profiles, which are often used for spreading misinformation, identity theft, and phishing.

This project aims to build a machine learning-based detection model that distinguishes between real and fake Twitter profiles using various classification algorithms. The goal is to enhance cybersecurity by identifying and eliminating fake accounts effectively.

⚙ Technologies Used

Programming Language: Python

Libraries: Scikit-learn (Sklearn), NumPy, Pandas

Algorithms: Decision Tree, Random Forest, XGBoost


🧠 Methodology

A dataset of Twitter profiles (both real and fake) is used for model training and testing.

Important features/attributes are selected to evaluate the authenticity of social media accounts.

Multiple ML models are trained, tuned using hyperparameter optimization, and compared for accuracy.

The final model outputs:

0 → Genuine profile

1 → Fake profile



🚀 Results

The trained models successfully detect fake Twitter profiles with high accuracy. Once identified, these profiles can be flagged or removed to prevent potential cybersecurity threats.

🧩 Future Scope

Integration with live social media APIs for real-time detection.

Extending the model to other platforms like Facebook and Instagram.

Implementing deep learning techniques for enhanced performance.# Fake-Profile-Detection
